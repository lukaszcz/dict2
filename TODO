* ugly loading dialog when loading cached files

* hints to mmap
   (random access - to avoid performance degrading readahead)

* bash <-> bashful - doesn't work even with 'stem'. Why?

* documentation: wfa.pdf

* tests, tests, tests

* history (back, forward, etc)

* easier switching between languages

* the scan feature
   (and the status bar icon - without the scan feature the icon is
   rather useless, so it's not worth to implement it)

* fuzzy search
   (read "Jewels of Stringology", W. Rytter, M. Crochemore)

* exception rules for 'forms', 'stem' and 'inflect' options
   to avoid occasional absurdal word formation (bus - busy; inside,
   outside - side); this seems to be a rather difficult problem - no
   general rule

* command line queries

* different dictionary file character encodings:
   generalise the dictionary file format

* more languages

* optimize:
   (2/3 time of keyword search) add_wforms, (1/3 time of keyword
   search) lst_cmp - get rid of g_utf8_collate first of all

* translate the interface into German
   if my German language skills permit (or find a native speaker)
