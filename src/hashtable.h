/*
  The hashtable stores offsets to keys, which are strings. Keys are not null-
  terminated. Their length is stored together with their offsets. Offsets are
  with respect to file_start - a pointer to the mmapped file where _all_ the
  strings from the hashtable are stored. file_start is passed as a parameter
  to hashtable_create.
  A hashtable may be cached. Cached hashtables are created from within
  cache.c. hashtable_create creates only non-cached hashtables. This is
  because it makes sense only to cache a hashtable together with its
  associated dict_t.
  The values associated with the keys are lists of entry_line_idx
  (see dict_t).

  NOTE: A hashtable may store strings (as keys) from only _one_ mmapped file.
