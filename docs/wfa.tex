\section{Problem statement}

Given a string \verb#w# representing a word in a language \verb#L#,
we wish to obtain all words in \verb#L# that may be derived from
\verb#w# according to some predefined rules \verb#R# for that language.

For instance, if the language is German and \verb#w = "machen"#, we
would like to obtain ``gemacht'', ``machte'', etc. The set of rules
\verb#R# should contain rules for inflecting words and forming
other derivatives.

\section{Rules}

The algorithm actually uses several sets of rules for one
language. Rules for ``inflect'', ``stem'' and ``forms'' options are
stored in separate files on disk.
